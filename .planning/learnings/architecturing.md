# Architecture

Electron, React and Vite, TanStack, sqlite3, pyhton
React components are easy to organize in a visual way.
Less easy is understanding separation of data from UI.
I have always known this separation is important
but was not sure how it was to be architected.
There is no single set of rules for how to do this
so this always felt vague and amorphous.
Finding best practice was always difficult since I am not an insider.
AI gave me the insights and my own intuition brought
some clarity of architecture, especially when designing
individual features for an app.

Examples: architecture for the rubric;
Architecture for handling the folder selection and file
representation in the UI. This has to feel
intuitive for teachers, flexible for varied organization of folders
e.g., an unzipped Moodle assignment download contains nested folders
and adaptable to student misunderstandings.
