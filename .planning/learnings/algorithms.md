# What AI taught me about algorithms
I already know what algorithms are. They are systematic ways
of looping over data and reorganizing it or reprrsenting it in a new way.
The hard thing aboiy algorithms is making them efficient.
In building the rubric, I learned a few neat algorithmic tricks.

Sets and Arrays as strategies to transform tepeated data.
Noranlization to change O(n^2) lookup to O(1) lookup.

Could i have learned this from a textbook? sure! would i have learned how
to apply it? probably in some isolated case i would not care aboit.
But through iterative learning with AI i learned
that not only how to build these algorithms, but how to ise them
and why they are wffective.

This democratization of knowledge thanks to AI is a huge boon.
