 - RubricForReact.tsx is the orchestration layer.
      - Holds local mode (editing/viewing) and grading selection (selectedCellKeys).
      - Uses useRubricState(sourceData) for all rubric mutations.
      - Renders RubricToolbar only in editing mode.
      - Renders RubricTable in all modes and passes handlers/class overrides.
      - In grading mode, enforces one selected score per category (selecting a cell clears prior selection in that category).
      - Emits onChange(state) whenever rubric state changes.
  - RubricTable.tsx is pure presentation + interaction dispatch.
      - Header row = categories, first column = score axis.
      - Editing mode: category/score inputs + delete controls + cell textareas.
      - Viewing mode: read-only cell text.
      - Grading mode: cell buttons with selected state.
  - RubricToolbar.tsx handles rubric-level edits.
      - Rename rubric.
      - Add category (string).
      - Add score (numeric).
  - useRubricState.ts is the reducer/API layer.
      - Actions: hydrate, set rubric name, add/remove/rename category, add/remove/set score, set cell description.
      - Maintains normalized shape with maps + order arrays.
      - Keeps score order sorted descending by numeric value.
      - Uses generated IDs for new category/score rows.
  - normalize.ts is the shape adapter/invariant enforcer.
      - Accepts either source format or normalized format.
      - Ensures valid categoryOrder/scoreOrder, fills missing cells for full matrix.
      - Provides createCellKey and ID generation helper.
  - hooks.ts is TanStack Query mutation/query wiring for server sync.
      - Query: load detailed rubric, transform via buildDraft.
      - Mutations: optimistic update for cell description; others invalidate and refetch.
      - Current filename is generic (hooks.ts), as you noted.
  - fakeserver.ts simulates backend table-style persistence.
      - Mimics rubric, details, scores relational model.
      - Exposes CRUD-like operations aligned to future IPC/server contracts.
      - createCategory and createScore expand the matrix by generating missing rows across existing axis values.
  - rubricDraft.ts is the DB-to-UI adapter.
      - Converts relational rows into normalized grid state used by RubricForReact.
      - Preserves linkage metadata (detailId, scoreRowId) in cells for update operations.
