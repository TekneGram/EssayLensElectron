# Outline

## Goal
- Create subcomponents and layout and state management for ChatInterface component.
- Ensure styles match current website layout.

## ChatInterface components
- HighlightDisplay: this component takes any highlighted text from
the OriginalTextView, truncates it and displays it in this component
- ChatInput: a simple input field for chatting with LLM
- CommandDropdown: a dropdown menu containing a list of commands that when chosen
steer the chat input message towards different APIs.
- CommandDisplay: displays the command that was selected, replaces it with a new one if another is selected.
The user can only select one command at a time.

## Layout
- CommandDisplay and HighlightDisplay sit side by side, CommandDisplay on the left, and both are positioned above the ChatInput.
- the CommandDropdown, ChatInput and the send button are side by side horizontally positioned.

## Styles
- all components are grouped within the ChatInterface border which is very light.
- no borders around any of the components
- no background colors within the components.
- components should look invisible except for the light border around the ChatInterface.
Look at the styles guide in the .planning folder to recommend concrete styles for these components.

*Create a new folder in .planning folder called chat-interface and write an html and css mockup of the chat interface. Before doing so, look at the current mockups in .planning/
