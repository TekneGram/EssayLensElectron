the OriginalTextView, truncates it and displays it in this component
- ChatInput: a simple input field for chatting with LLM
- CommandDropdown: a dropdown menu containing a list of commands that when chosen
steer the chat input message towards different APIs.
- CommandDisplay: displays the command that was selected, replaces it with a new one if another is selected.
The user can only select one command at a time.
